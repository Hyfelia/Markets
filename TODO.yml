TODO:
- Test buying items
- shop setSize breaks the gui items and is removing/not showing some items
- Changing Max Site results in items not being added in first inventory and GUI Items are removeable
- Changing Size to a smaller size? (Removes gui row)

- What if player ressizes Shop and adds a new Item. Then the site would save into the database, even the items from another site as well.
