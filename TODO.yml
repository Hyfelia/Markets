TODO:
- Search menu doesn't show shop and back doesn't work
- Test buying items
- shop setSize doesn't update Shop Size and also shows second site, if empty (after reload works)
- items being added on the second site, even if first site is empty
- Gui Items missing? (Might be only for new loading. On create they exists) (Only if one site? Then there shouldnt be any)
- Changing Max Site results in items not being added in first inventory and GUI Items are removeable
- Changing Size to a smaller size? (Removes gui row)

- Cleanup Task, which scans the Shop Inventories for null sell and buy?

DONE:
- /shop setMaxSite
